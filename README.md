# joblisting
This is a job listing website
In this website i have used node.js and express.js and i have used MySQL for creating a databse for login and sign up.Then i have used javascript get date() function for changing the color of the cards depending on the deadline conditions given in the assignment.Also i have included some styling and fading effects in css.Finally i tried drag and drop function using javascript but i was unable to achieve it.At the same time i also could not create a seperate terafformers portal as i didnt have enough time to do it.Thank you:)
