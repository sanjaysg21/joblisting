# joblisting
This is a job listing website
In this website i have used node.js and express.js and i have used MySQL for creating a databse for login and sign up.Then i have used javascript get date() function for changing the color of the cards depending on the deadline conditions given in the assignment.Also i have included some styling and fading effects in css.Finally i tried drag and drop function using javascript but i was unable to achieve it.At the same time i also could not create a seperate terafformers portal as i didnt have enough time to do it.To deploy the website most of the web hosting like heroku,etc were changed to paid service.So i couldnt afford to get that service.So what i have done
is i have hosted my login and sign up page seperately and home page seperately and these are completely static and you can get view of what my created web page will be.Also in server.js code i have used node.js and hosted in localhost:8080 so it is completely dynamic website when i created it.Thank you:)
